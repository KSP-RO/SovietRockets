**I HIGHLY reccommend downloading my [Salyut Stations and Soyuz Ferries](https://github.com/KSP-RO/SalyutStations-SoyuzFerries) & [Soviet Probes](https://github.com/KSP-RO/SovietProbes) to use with this mod as all of them are made specifically for these launchers.**

This mod contains my rockets that were originally part of the Soviet Probes mod. I split them off into their own mod for people who only want to use the rockets.
